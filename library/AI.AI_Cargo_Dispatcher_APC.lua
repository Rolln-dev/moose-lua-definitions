---**AI** - Models the intelligent transportation of infantry and other cargo using APCs.
---
---## Features:
---
---  * Quickly transport cargo to various deploy zones using ground vehicles (APCs, trucks ...).
---  * Various Cargo.Cargo#CARGO types can be transported. These are infantry groups and crates.
---  * Define a list of deploy zones of various types to transport the cargo to.
---  * The vehicles follow the roads to ensure the fastest possible cargo transportation over the ground.
---  * Multiple vehicles can transport multiple cargo as one vehicle group.
---  * Multiple vehicle groups can be enabled as one collaborating transportation process.
---  * Infantry loaded as cargo, will unboard in case enemies are nearby and will help defending the vehicles.
---  * Different ranges can be setup for enemy defenses.
---  * Different options can be setup to tweak the cargo transporation behaviour.

---A dynamic cargo transportation capability for AI groups.
---
---![Banner Image](..\Images\deprecated.png)
---
---Armoured Personnel APCs (APC), Trucks, Jeeps and other carrier equipment can be mobilized to intelligently transport infantry and other cargo within the simulation.
---
---The AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_APC module is derived from the AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER module.
---
---## Note! In order to fully understand the mechanisms of the AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_APC class, it is recommended that you first consult and READ the documentation of the AI.AI_Cargo_Dispatcher module!!!
---
---Especially to learn how to **Tailor the different cargo handling events**, this will be very useful!
---
---On top, the AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_APC class uses the Cargo.Cargo capabilities within the MOOSE framework.
---Also ensure that you fully understand how to declare and setup Cargo objects within the MOOSE framework before using this class.
---CARGO derived objects must be declared within the mission to make the AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_HELICOPTER object recognize the cargo.
---
---
---# 1) AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_APC constructor.
---  
---  * #AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_APC.New(): Creates a new AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_APC object.
---
------
---
---# 2) AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_APC is a Finite State Machine.
---
---This section must be read as follows. Each of the rows indicate a state transition, triggered through an event, and with an ending state of the event was executed.
---The first column is the **From** state, the second column the **Event**, and the third column the **To** state.
---
---So, each of the rows have the following structure.
---
---  * **From** => **Event** => **To**
---
---Important to know is that an event can only be executed if the **current state** is the **From** state.
---This, when an **Event** that is being triggered has a **From** state that is equal to the **Current** state of the state machine, the event will be executed,
---and the resulting state will be the **To** state.
---
---These are the different possible state transitions of this state machine implementation: 
---
---  * Idle => Start => Monitoring
---  * Monitoring => Monitor => Monitoring
---  * Monitoring => Stop => Idle
---     
---  * Monitoring => Pickup => Monitoring
---  * Monitoring => Load => Monitoring
---  * Monitoring => Loading => Monitoring
---  * Monitoring => Loaded => Monitoring
---  * Monitoring => PickedUp => Monitoring
---  * Monitoring => Deploy => Monitoring
---  * Monitoring => Unload => Monitoring
---  * Monitoring => Unloaded => Monitoring
---  * Monitoring => Deployed => Monitoring
---  * Monitoring => Home => Monitoring
---
---     
---## 2.1) AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER States.
---
---  * **Monitoring**: The process is dispatching.
---  * **Idle**: The process is idle.
---
---## 2.2) AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER Events.
---
---  * **Start**: Start the transport process.
---  * **Stop**: Stop the transport process.
---  * **Monitor**: Monitor and take action.
---  
---  * **Pickup**: Pickup cargo.
---  * **Load**: Load the cargo.
---  * **Loading**: The dispatcher is coordinating the loading of a cargo.
---  * **Loaded**: Flag that the cargo is loaded.
---  * **PickedUp**: The dispatcher has loaded all requested cargo into the CarrierGroup.
---  * **Deploy**: Deploy cargo to a location.
---  * **Unload**: Unload the cargo.
---  * **Unloaded**: Flag that the cargo is unloaded.
---  * **Deployed**: All cargo is unloaded from the carriers in the group.
---  * **Home**: A Carrier is going home.
---
---## 2.3) Enhance your mission scripts with **Tailored** Event Handling!
---
---Within your mission, you can capture these events when triggered, and tailor the events with your own code!
---Check out the AI.AI_Cargo_Dispatcher#AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER class at chapter 3 for details on the different event handlers that are available and how to use them.
---
---**There are a lot of templates available that allows you to quickly setup an event handler for a specific event type!**
---
------
---
---# 3) Set the pickup parameters.
---
---Several parameters can be set to pickup cargo:
---
---   * #AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_APC.SetPickupRadius(): Sets or randomizes the pickup location for the APC around the cargo coordinate in a radius defined an outer and optional inner radius. 
---   * #AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_APC.SetPickupSpeed(): Set the speed or randomizes the speed in km/h to pickup the cargo.
---   
---# 4) Set the deploy parameters.
---
---Several parameters can be set to deploy cargo:
---
---   * #AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_APC.SetDeployRadius(): Sets or randomizes the deploy location for the APC around the cargo coordinate in a radius defined an outer and an optional inner radius. 
---   * #AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_APC.SetDeploySpeed(): Set the speed or randomizes the speed in km/h to deploy the cargo.
---
---# 5) Set the home zone when there isn't any more cargo to pickup.
---
---A home zone can be specified to where the APCs will move when there isn't any cargo left for pickup.
---Use #AI_CARGO_DISPATCHER_APC.SetHomeZone() to specify the home zone.
---
---If no home zone is specified, the APCs will wait near the deploy zone for a new pickup command.

---# Developer Note
---
---Note while this class still works, it is no longer supported as the original author stopped active development of MOOSE
---Therefore, this class is considered to be deprecated
