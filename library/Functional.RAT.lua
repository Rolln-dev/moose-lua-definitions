---**Functional** - Create random air traffic in your missions.
---
---===
---
---The aim of the RAT class is to fill the empty DCS world with randomized air traffic and bring more life to your airports.
---In particular, it is designed to spawn AI air units at random airports. These units will be assigned a random flight path to another random airport on the map.
---Even the mission designer will not know where aircraft will be spawned and which route they follow.
---
---## Features:
---
---  * Very simple interface. Just one unit and two lines of Lua code needed to fill your map.
---  * High degree of randomization. Aircraft will spawn at random airports, have random routes and random destinations.
---  * Specific departure and/or destination airports can be chosen.
---  * Departure and destination airports can be restricted by coalition.
---  * Planes and helicopters supported. Helicopters can also be send to FARPs and ships.
---  * Units can also be spawned in air within pre-defined zones of the map.
---  * Aircraft will be removed when they arrive at their destination (or get stuck on the ground).
---  * When a unit is removed a new unit with a different flight plan is respawned.
---  * Aircraft can report their status during the route.
---  * All of the above can be customized by the user if necessary.
---  * All current (Caucasus, Nevada, Normandy, Persian Gulf) and future maps are supported.
---
---The RAT class creates an entry in the F10 radio menu which allows to:
---
---  * Create new groups on-the-fly, i.e. at run time within the mission,
---  * Destroy specific groups (e.g. if they get stuck or damaged and block a runway),
---  * Request the status of all RAT aircraft or individual groups,
---  * Place markers at waypoints on the F10 map for each group.
---
---Note that by its very nature, this class is suited best for civil or transport aircraft. However, it also works perfectly fine for military aircraft of any kind.
---
---More of the documentation include some simple examples can be found further down this page.

---
---## Airport Selection
---
---![Process](..\Presentations\RAT\RAT_Airport_Selection.png)
---
---### Default settings:
---
---* By default, aircraft are spawned at airports of their own coalition (blue or red) or neutral airports.
---* Destination airports are by default also of neutral or of the same coalition as the template group of the spawned aircraft.
---* Possible destinations are restricted by their distance to the departure airport. The maximal distance depends on the max range of spawned aircraft type and its initial fuel amount.
---
---### The default behavior can be changed:
---
---* A specific departure and/or destination airport can be chosen.
---* Valid coalitions can be set, e.g. only red, blue or neutral, all three "colours".
---* It is possible to start in air within a zone or within a zone above an airport of the map.
---
---## Flight Plan
---
---![Process](..\Presentations\RAT\RAT_Flight_Plan.png)
---
---* A general flight plan has five main airborne segments: Climb, cruise, descent, holding and final approach.
---* Events monitored during the flight are: birth, engine-start, take-off, landing and engine-shutdown.
---* The default flight level (FL) is set to ~FL200, i.e. 20000 feet ASL but randomized for each aircraft.
---Service ceiling of aircraft type is into account for max FL as well as the distance between departure and destination.
---* Maximal distance between destination and departure airports depends on range and initial fuel of aircraft.
---* Climb rate is set to a moderate value of ~1500 ft/min.
---* The standard descent rate follows the 3:1 rule, i.e. 1000 ft decent per 3 miles of travel. Hence, angle of descent is ~3.6 degrees.
---* A holding point is randomly selected at a distance between 5 and 10 km away from destination airport.
---* The altitude of the holding point is ~1200 m AGL. Holding patterns might or might not happen with variable duration.
---* If an aircraft is spawned in air, the procedure omits taxi and take-off and starts with the climb/cruising part.
---* All values are randomized for each spawned aircraft.
---
---## Mission Editor Setup
---
---![Process](..\Presentations\RAT\RAT_Mission_Setup.png)
---
---Basic mission setup is very simple and essentially a three step process:
---
---* Place your aircraft **anywhere** on the map. It really does not matter where you put it.
---* Give the group a good name. In the example above the group is named "RAT_YAK".
---* Activate the "LATE ACTIVATION" tick box. Note that this aircraft will not be spawned itself but serves a template for each RAT aircraft spawned when the mission starts.
---
---Voil√†, your already done!
---
---Optionally, you can set a specific livery for the aircraft or give it some weapons.
---However, the aircraft will by default not engage any enemies. Think of them as being on a peaceful or ferry mission.
---
---## Basic Lua Script
---
---![Process](..\Presentations\RAT\RAT_Basic_Lua_Script.png)
---
---The basic Lua script for one template group consists of two simple lines as shown in the picture above.
---
---* **Line 2** creates a new RAT object "yak". The only required parameter for the constructor #RAT.New() is the name of the group as defined in the mission editor. In this example it is "RAT_YAK".
---* **Line 5** trigger the command to spawn the aircraft. The (optional) parameter for the #RAT.Spawn() function is the number of aircraft to be spawned of this object.
---By default each of these aircraft gets a random departure airport anywhere on the map and a random destination airport, which lies within range of the of the selected aircraft type.
---
---In this simple example aircraft are respawned with a completely new flightplan when they have reached their destination airport.
---The "old" aircraft is despawned (destroyed) after it has shut-down its engines and a new aircraft of the same type is spawned at a random departure airport anywhere on the map.
---Hence, the default flight plan for a RAT aircraft will be: Fly from airport A to B, get respawned at C and fly to D, get respawned at E and fly to F, ...
---This ensures that you always have a constant number of AI aircraft on your map.
---
---## Parking Problems
---
---One big issue in DCS is that not all aircraft can be spawned on every airport or airbase. In particular, bigger aircraft might not have a valid parking spot at smaller airports and
---airstrips. This can lead to multiple problems in DCS.
---
---* Landing: When an aircraft tries to land at an airport where it does not have a valid parking spot, it is immediately despawned the moment its wheels touch the runway, i.e.
---when a landing event is triggered. This leads to the loss of the RAT aircraft. On possible way to circumvent the this problem is to let another RAT aircraft spawn at landing
---and not when it shuts down its engines. See the #RAT.RespawnAfterLanding() function.
---* Spawning: When a big aircraft is dynamically spawned on a small airbase a few things can go wrong. For example, it could be spawned at a parking spot with a shelter.
---Or it could be damaged by a scenery object when it is taxiing out to the runway, or it could overlap with other aircraft on parking spots near by.
---
---You can check yourself if an aircraft has a valid parking spot at an airbase by dragging its group on the airport in the mission editor and set it to start from ramp.
---If it stays at the airport, it has a valid parking spot, if it jumps to another airport, it does not have a valid parking spot on that airbase.
---
---### Setting the Terminal Type
---Each parking spot has a specific type depending on its size or if a helicopter spot or a shelter etc. The classification is not perfect but it is the best we have.
---If you encounter problems described above, you can request a specific terminal type for the RAT aircraft. This can be done by the #RAT.SetTerminalType(*terminaltype*)
---function. The parameter *terminaltype* can be set as follows
---
---* AIRBASE.TerminalType.HelicopterOnly: Special spots for Helicopers.
---* AIRBASE.TerminalType.Shelter: Hardened Air Shelter. Currently only on Caucaus map.
---* AIRBASE.TerminalType.OpenMed: Open/Shelter air airplane only.
---* AIRBASE.TerminalType.OpenBig: Open air spawn points. Generally larger but does not guarantee large aircraft are capable of spawning there.
---* AIRBASE.TerminalType.OpenMedOrBig: Combines OpenMed and OpenBig spots.
---* AIRBASE.TerminalType.HelicopterUsable: Combines HelicopterOnly, OpenMed and OpenBig.
---* AIRBASE.TerminalType.FighterAircraft: Combines Shelter, OpenMed and OpenBig spots. So effectively all spots usable by fixed wing aircraft.
---
---So for example
---     c17=RAT:New("C-17")
---     c17:SetTerminalType(AIRBASE.TerminalType.OpenBig)
---     c17:Spawn(5)
---
---This would randomly spawn five C-17s but only on airports which have big open air parking spots. Note that also only destination airports are allowed
---which do have this type of parking spot. This should ensure that the aircraft is able to land at the destination without being despawned immediately.
---
---Also, the aircraft are spawned only on the requested parking spot types and not on any other type. If no parking spot of this type is available at the
---moment of spawning, the group is automatically spawned in air above the selected airport.
---
---## Examples
---
---Here are a few examples, how you can modify the default settings of RAT class objects.
---
---### Specify Departure and Destinations
---
---![Process](..\Presentations\RAT\RAT_Examples_Specify_Departure_and_Destination.png)
---
---In the picture above you find a few possibilities how to modify the default behaviour to spawn at random airports and fly to random destinations.
---
---In particular, you can specify fixed departure and/or destination airports. This is done via the #RAT.SetDeparture() or #RAT.SetDestination() functions, respectively.
---
---* If you only fix a specific departure airport via #RAT.SetDeparture() all aircraft will be spawned at that airport and get random destination airports.
---* If you only fix the destination airport via #RAT.SetDestination(), aircraft a spawned at random departure airports but will all fly to the destination airport.
---* If you fix departure and destination airports, aircraft will only travel from between those airports.
---When the aircraft reaches its destination, it will be respawned at its departure and fly again to its destination.
---
---There is also an option that allows aircraft to "continue their journey" from their destination. This is achieved by the #RAT.ContinueJourney() function.
---In that case, when the aircraft arrives at its first destination it will be respawned at that very airport and get a new random destination.
---So the flight plan in this case would be: Fly from airport A to B, then from B to C, then from C to D, ...
---
---It is also possible to make aircraft "commute" between two airports, i.e. flying from airport A to B and then back from B to A, etc.
---This can be done by the #RAT.Commute() function. Note that if no departure or destination airports are specified, the first departure and destination are chosen randomly.
---Then the aircraft will fly back and forth between those two airports indefinitely.
---
---
---### Spawn in Air
---
---![Process](..\Presentations\RAT\RAT_Examples_Spawn_in_Air.png)
---
---Aircraft can also be spawned in air rather than at airports on the ground. This is done by setting #RAT.SetTakeoff() to "air".
---
---By default, aircraft are spawned randomly above airports of the map.
---
---The #RAT.SetDeparture() option can be used to specify zones, which have been defined in the mission editor as departure zones.
---Aircraft will then be spawned at a random point within the zone or zones.
---
---Note that #RAT.SetDeparture() also accepts airport names. For an air takeoff these are treated like zones with a radius of XX kilometers.
---Again, aircraft are spawned at random points within these zones around the airport.
---
---### Misc Options
---
---![Process](..\Presentations\RAT\RAT_Examples_Misc.png)
---
---The default "takeoff" type of RAT aircraft is that they are spawned with hot or cold engines.
---The choice is random, so 50% of aircraft will be spawned with hot engines while the other 50% will be spawned with cold engines.
---This setting can be changed using the #RAT.SetTakeoff() function. The possible parameters for starting on ground are:
---
---*  #RAT.SetTakeoff("cold"), which means that all aircraft are spawned with their engines off,
---*  #RAT.SetTakeoff("hot"), which means that all aircraft are spawned with their engines on,
---*  #RAT.SetTakeoff("runway"), which means that all aircraft are spawned already at the runway ready to takeoff.
---Note that in this case the default spawn intervall is set to 180 seconds in order to avoid aircraft jams on the runway. Generally, this takeoff at runways should be used with care and problems are to be expected.
---
---
---The options #RAT.SetMinDistance() and #RAT.SetMaxDistance() can be used to restrict the range from departure to destination. For example
---
---* #RAT.SetMinDistance(100) will cause only random destination airports to be selected which are **at least** 100 km away from the departure airport.
---* #RAT.SetMaxDistance(150) will allow only destination airports which are **less than** 150 km away from the departure airport.
---
---![Process](..\Presentations\RAT\RAT_Gaussian.png)
---
---By default planes get a cruise altitude of ~20,000 ft ASL. The actual altitude is sampled from a Gaussian distribution. The picture shows this distribution
---if one would spawn 1000 planes. As can be seen most planes get a cruising alt of around FL200. Other values are possible but less likely the further away
---one gets from the expectation value.
---
---The expectation value, i.e. the altitude most aircraft get, can be set with the function #RAT.SetFLcruise().
---It is possible to restrict the minimum cruise altitude by #RAT.SetFLmin() and the maximum cruise altitude by #RAT.SetFLmax()
---
---The cruise altitude can also be given in meters ASL by the functions #RAT.SetCruiseAltitude(), #RAT.SetMinCruiseAltitude() and #RAT.SetMaxCruiseAltitude().
---
---For example:
---
---* #RAT.SetFLcruise(300) will cause most planes fly around FL300.
---* #RAT.SetFLmin(100) restricts the cruising alt such that no plane will fly below FL100. Note that this automatically changes the minimum distance from departure to destination.
---That means that only destinations are possible for which the aircraft has had enough time to reach that flight level and descent again.
---* #RAT.SetFLmax(200) will restrict the cruise alt to maximum FL200, i.e. no aircraft will travel above this height.

---# RATMANAGER class, extends Core.Base#BASE
---The RATMANAGER class manages spawning of multiple RAT objects in a very simple way.
---It is created by the  #RATMANAGER.New() contructor.
---RAT objects with different "tasks" can be defined as usual. However, they **must not** be spawned via the #RAT.Spawn() function.
---
---Instead, these objects can be added to the manager via the #RATMANAGER.Add(ratobject, min) function, where the first parameter "ratobject" is the #RAT object, while the second parameter "min" defines the
---minimum number of RAT aircraft of that object, which are alive at all time.
---
---The #RATMANAGER must be started by the #RATMANAGER.Start(startime) function, where the optional argument "startime" specifies the delay time in seconds after which the manager is started and the spawning beginns.
---If desired, the #RATMANAGER can be stopped by the #RATMANAGER.Stop(stoptime) function. The parameter "stoptime" specifies the time delay in seconds after which the manager stops.
---When this happens, no new aircraft will be spawned and the population will eventually decrease to zero.
---
---When you are using a time intervall like #RATMANAGER.dTspawn(delay), #RATMANAGER will ignore the amount set with #RATMANAGER.New(). #RATMANAGER.dTspawn(delay) will spawn infinite groups.
---
---## Example
---In this example, three different #RAT objects are created (but not spawned manually). The #RATMANAGER takes care that at least five aircraft of each type are alive and that the total number of aircraft
---spawned is 25. The #RATMANAGER is started after 30 seconds and stopped after two hours.
