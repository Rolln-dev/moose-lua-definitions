---**Ops** - Enhanced Naval Group.
---
---## Main Features:
---
---   * Let the group steam into the wind
---   * Command a full stop
---   * Patrol waypoints *ad infinitum*
---   * Collision warning, if group is heading towards a land mass or another obstacle
---   * Automatic pathfinding, e.g. around islands
---   * Let a submarine dive and surface
---   * Manage TACAN and ICLS beacons
---   * Dynamically add and remove waypoints
---   * Sophisticated task queueing system (know when DCS tasks start and end)
---   * Convenient checks when the group enters or leaves a zone
---   * Detection events for new, known and lost units
---   * Simple LASER and IR-pointer setup
---   * Compatible with AUFTRAG class
---   * Many additional events that the mission designer can hook into
